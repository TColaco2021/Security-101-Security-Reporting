What is formjacking? 

Formjacking is a type of cyber attack in which hackers insert malicious JavaScript code into a target website payment checkout page in order to steal user payment information details from payment methods such as credit cards or debit cards. 

How many websites are compromised each month with formjacking code? 

The Symantec Internet Security Threat Report 2019 states that formjackers hacked 4,818 unique websites per month in 2018.

What is Powershell? 

PowerShell is a cross-platform task automation solution (a software that allows you to test how other software is functioning). It is composed of a command-line shell, a scripting language, and a configuration management framework. PowerShell is very convenient because it runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

What was the annual percentage increase in malicious Powershell scripts? 

There was a 1000% increase in the malicious Powershell scripts.

What is a coinminer? 

Coinminers are programs that create Bitcoin, Monero, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies.

How much can data from a single credit card can be sold for? 

Data from a single credit card can be sold for up to $45 on underground markets. To give greater context, 10 credit cards stolen from compromised websites could result in a yield of up to $2.2 million for cyber criminals each month.

How did Magecart successfully attack Ticketmaster? 

Magecart compromised a third-party chatbot, which then loaded malicious code into the web browsers of visitors to Ticketmaster’s website. This was done with the goal of harvesting customers' payment Data.

What is one reason why there has been a growth of formjacking? 

The growth in formjacking in 2018 may be partially explained by the drop in the value of cryptocurrencies during the year. Those cyber criminals who may have used websites for cryptojacking may now be shifting to formjacking.

Cryptojacking dropped by what percentage between January and December 2018?
Cryptojacking activity dropped by 52 percent between January and December 2018.

If a web page contains a coinmining script, what happens? 
If a web page contains a coinmining script, the web page visitors’ computing power will be utilized to mine for cryptocurrency for as long as the web page is open. Browser-based miners permit cyber criminals to target even fully patched devices and can also allow them to operate without the activity being noticed by victims.

How does an exploit kit work? 

Exploit kits are automated threat tools that use compromised sites to divert web traffic, scan for vulnerable browser-based applications, and run malware. Attackers use exploit kits with the end goal of establishing control of a device in an automated and simplified manner. 

What does the criminal group SamSam specialize in? 

SamSam specializes in targeted ransomware attacks. They break into networks and encrypt multiple computers across an organization before issuing a high-value ransom demand.

How many SamSam attacks did Symantec find evidence of in 2018? 

Throughout 2018, Symantec found evidence of 67 SamSam attacks, mostly against organizations in the U.S.

Even though ransomware attacks declined in 2017-2018, what was one dramatic change that occurred? 

Up until 2017, consumers were the hardest hit by ransomware, accounting for the majority of infections. In 2017, the majority of infections occurred in businesses. In 2018, enterprises accounted for 81 percent of all ransomware infections.

In 2018, what was the primary ransomware distribution method? 

During 2018, the main ransomware distribution method was email campaigns.

What operating systems do most types of ransomware attacks still target?

Windows computers are the most vulnerable to malware attacks and are thus targeted more than any other operating system.

What are “living off the land” attacks? What is the advantage to hackers? 

A Living off the Land attack is a cyberattack in which intruders use legitimate software and functions available in the system to perform malicious actions on it. Attackers forage on target systems for tools, such as operating system components or installed software, they can use to achieve their goals. The main advantage of such attacks is that they are fileless and thus do not leave any evidence behind. 
 
What is an example of a tool that’s used in “living off the land” attacks?

An example of such an attack tool is Powershell. It is a script-launching framework that offers broad functionality for Windows device administration. Attackers can use PowerShell to launch malicious scripts, escalate privileges, install backdoors, and so on.
 
What are zero-day exploits? 

A zero-day vulnerability is a software security flaw that is known to the software vendor (or anyone for that matter) but doesn't have a patch in place to fix the flaw.
 
By what percentage did zero-day exploits decline in 2018? 

In 2018, only 23 percent of attack groups were known to use zero days, down from 27 percent in 2017. This represented an overall 4 % decline from the previous year.
 
What are two techniques that worms such as Emotet and Qakbot use?

Emotet (Trojan.Emotet) and Qakbot (W32. Qakbot) use simple techniques such as dumping passwords from memory or brute-forcing access to network shares to laterally move across a network.
 
What are supply chain attacks? By how much did they increase in 2018?

Supply chain attacks exploit third-party services and software to compromise a final target. They take many forms, including hijacking software updates and injecting malicious code into legitimate software. These attacks increased by 78 percent in 2018.
 
What challenge do supply chain attacks and living off the land attacks highlight for organizations? 

Supply chain and living off the land attacks highlight the challenges facing organizations with attacks increasingly occurring through trusted channels, using fileless attack methods or legitimate tools for malicious purposes.
 
The 20 most active groups tracked by Symantec targeted an average of how many organizations between 2016 and 2018? 

The 20 most active groups tracked by Symantec targeted an average of 55 organizations between 2016 and 2018.
 
How many individuals or organizations were indicted for cyber criminal activities in 2018? What are some of the countries that these entities were from? 

Forty-nine individuals or organizations were indicted during 2018 in the United States for cybercriminal activities. 
 
When it comes to the increased number of cloud cybersecurity attacks, what is the common theme? One notable trend was target diversification. A growing number of groups displayed an interest in compromising operational computers, which could potentially permit them to mount disruptive operations.

What is the implication for successful cloud exploitation that provides access to memory locations that are normally forbidden? 

While cloud instances have their own virtual processors, they share pools of memory—meaning that a successful attack on a single physical system could result in data being leaked from several cloud instances.

What are two examples of the above cloud attack? Meltdown and Spectre. 

Regarding Internet of Things (IoT) attacks, what were the two most common infected devices and what percentage of IoT attacks were attributed to them? Routers and connected cameras were the most infected devices and were responsible for 75 and 15 percent of the attacks respectively.

What is the Mirai worm and what does it do? Mirai is a distributed denial of service (DDoS) worm. It infects smart devices that run on ARC processors, transforming them into a network of remotely controlled bots that are often used to launch DDoS attacks. Mirai worm variants use up to 16 different exploits, persistently adding new exploits to increase the successful infection rate, as devices often remain unpatched. 

Why was Mirai the third most common IoT threat in 2018? Mirai does not have the ability to survive a reboot making it easier to purge from an infected system.

What was unique about VPNFilter with regards to IoT threats?

VPNFilter was the first widespread persistent IoT threat due to its ability to survive a reboot making it very difficult to remove. It has an array of potent payloads at its disposal, such as man in the middle attacks, data exfiltration, credential theft, and interception of SCADA communications. It also includes a destructive capability which can wipe a device at the attackers’ command, if they wish to destroy evidence. 

What type of attack targeted the Democratic National Committee in 2019? 

In January of 2019, the DNC was targeted by an unsuccessful spear-phishing attack. Spear phishing is an email or electronic communications scam that targets a specific individual, organization or business.
